With regard to partners, some potential partners were identified and noted in the homework documents; in other cases, when we identified our criteria for decision problem/locations to key informants, we explained that part of the criteria included interest in participating in MACH.  As such, we assume that all of the locations on the list have the potential for partnerships.

 With regard to plausible funding, we expressly excluded the only programs in the state for which funds have currently been earmarked for implementation (Rebuild by Design-funded Resilient NJ regions).  The question as to whether funds are CURRENTLY available for implementation is unknown."

Areas like [R1] have been intensively shaped by cleanup and dredging work. A lot of wetlands there were built with dredged materials (stabilized by mixing with cement etc.. to keep the hazardous chemicals in place). Therefore the landform in the [R1] area are being actively shaped by human behavior. Barrier islands are naturally at the forefront of geomorphological changes, which will in turn greatly affects the the magnitude of storm surge and wave actions during hurricane events. The barrier islands in [m2] just went through an intense change due to hurricane sandy and rebuilding effort. "

Sensitivity to changing landforms (H1),middling,promising,middling,middling,promising,promising,promising,promising,middling,promising,promising,promising,middling,"From the point of view of landscape change, there is a benefit from considering different communities within the same geologic unit. The list of communities we have can be separated into 1) the [anonymized] system, 2) the [anonymized] estuarine system, and 3) ocean-facing communities. 

With this perspective in mind, if the number of communities that can be included is limited, I would choose between [anonymized] or [anonymized] estuarine systems, as opposed to having a few communities in each. In this way, we can have a more complete picture of the interplay between precipitation-driven flooding, storm tidal surges, and landscape changes at least for one estuarine system. Having said that, there are some communities that might be too far upstream (e.g., [m5]) to be affected by tides. If there is a need to trim down the number of communities within an estuarine system, I would start with those located furthest upstream.

The magnitude of plan-view landscape change associated with the estuarine systems of interest here is significantly lower than for ocean-facing communities. Instead of plan-view landscape changes, we could study bathymetric changes, which are more likely to be of importance over the time scales of interest. Changes in estuarine depth dynamically interact with water levels and the risk of flooding. Thus, one potential direction of my group is to develop a 1D modeling framework that dynamically accounts for changes in estuarine depth, sea level, upstream water discharge, tidal range, sediment supply, and dredging activities.  

Landscape changes in ocean-facing communities are generally larger in general and I, therefore, gave all of them a high score.

The [anonymized] region as a whole is very promising, but probably a location in the [anonymized] part is most promising as it combines coastal, fluvial, and pluvial hazards with potential changes in tidal range (various forcing factors; has already happened in the past). The [R4] region looks particularly sensitive and has also a hydraulically interesting location at the outer side of a river bend (higher flow velocities and potential debris during flooding!?). The locations at the Barrier Islands at New Jersey's eastern shore are all similarly well suited (to the degree of my limited knowledge in the region); they experience full coastal hazards (large waves and surges), they are geomorphologically interesting, and are likely prone to pluvial flood risk as well. Fluvial flooding does not seem to be a big factor though, but maybe not as important for a CoPe project. From the sites in the larger New York/New Jersey region, [R3] sticks a bit out, as it combines coastal, fluvial and pluvial flood risk. I am sending my notes in a separate email just in case they might become helpful."
